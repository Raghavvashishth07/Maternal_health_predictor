# 🤰 Maternal Health Risk Predictor

This project is a **machine learning web app** that predicts maternal health risk levels — Low, Mid, or High — based on clinical health parameters. It is designed to assist in early detection of potential complications during pregnancy.

The app uses **Flask** for the backend, **HTML/CSS** for the UI, and machine learning libraries like **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** to process and predict results based on user input.
